# School_District_Analysis

## Overview 

Purpose:replace the inaccurate data for the 9th graders at Thomas High School while keeping the rest of the data intact. After that, the rest is the same as we did in our module. Metrics that analyzed are following: total school budget, per student capita, average math and reading score, the passing percent for math and reading, and the overall passing percentage.

## Results

Most of the metrics from the original analysis remained the same. It's reasonable because we have a large set of data. When removed a small part of the data (math and readoing scores of 9th graders at Thomas High School), the data would not be skewed dreastically.
